# Predict Clicked Ads Customer Classification with Machine Learning

### **Goal**
Enhance the efficacy of advertisements by pinpointing the right audience, thereby elevating response rates and profitability.

### **Procedure**
1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Modeling
4. Business Simulation & Recommendation

### **Tools Used**
- Jupyter Notebook

### **Results**
- Initial ad campaigns reflected satisfactory results with a conversion rate slightly above 50%.
- Post the application of our machine learning model, there was a marked uptick in the click rate, approaching an impressive 99%. This surge translates to considerable economic benefits, with profit percentages gravitating towards a remarkable 100%.

### **Business Recommendations**
- **Shorten Session Length**: Condense the user session duration by incentivizing early ad clicks. Achieve this by strategically positioning ads or tailoring site content for enhanced appeal.
